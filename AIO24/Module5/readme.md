# Module 5

## **Overview**
Module 5 of the **AIO24** course is an introduction to Deep learning. This module introduces learners to probabilistic models like logistic regression, advanced softmax-based classification, and neural networks with multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) implemented using PyTorch.

## **Topics Covered**

### **1. Logistic Regression**
- **Binary Classification Algorithm** based on probability theory.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Sigmoid activation: \( \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \)
  - Cost Function: Binary Cross-Entropy
  - Gradient descent for parameter optimization
- **Applications**: Email spam detection, medical diagnosis, binary classification tasks

### **2. Softmax Regression**
- **Extension of Logistic Regression** for **multi-class classification**.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Softmax function for probability distribution over classes
  - Cross-entropy loss for multi-class output
  - Implemented using **PyTorch**

### **3. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
- **Feedforward Neural Network** with one or more hidden layers.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh
  - Forward and backward propagation
  - Training with gradient-based optimization
- **Implemented in PyTorch** to showcase deep learning principles
