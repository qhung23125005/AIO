# Module 8

## **Overview**
Module 8 of the **AIO24** course introduces the foundations and applications of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It focuses on tasks that require understanding and generating human language, using both classical sequence models and modern transformer-based approaches.

## **Topics Covered**

### **1. POS Tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- **Sequence Labeling Tasks** in NLP.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS)**: Assigning grammatical tags (noun, verb, etc.) to each token in a sentence.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying named entities such as people, locations, and organizations.

### **2. Machine Translation**
- Translating sentences between languages using deep learning models.
- Topics Covered:
  - Encoder-Decoder architecture with attention
  - Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning
- Focus on training and evaluating models on bilingual corpora.
