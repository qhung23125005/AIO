# Module 7

## **Overview**
Module 7 of the **AIO24** course dives into core topics of **Computer Vision**, focusing on both low-level vision tasks and high-level visual understanding. This module provides practical experience with image enhancement techniques, image generation, and object detection systems using YOLO architectures.

## **Topics Covered**

### **1. Domain Conversion**
- Focuses on enhancing and restoring images through:
  - **Image Super-Resolution**: Reconstructing high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs.
  - **Image Inpainting**: Filling in missing or corrupted regions of images using deep learning techniques.

### **2. YOLOv1**
- **YOLOv1 (You Only Look Once)** implementation from scratch.
- Core Concepts:
  - Unified object detection as a regression problem
  - Grid-based bounding box prediction
  - Class probability estimation

### **3. YOLO applications**
- Applies **YOLO models from the Ultralytics library** for various real-world applications, including:
  - **Object Counting**
  - **Multi-class Detection**
