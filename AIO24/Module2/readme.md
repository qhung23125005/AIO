# Module 2 

## Overview
Module 2 of the **AIO24** course covers fundamental mathematical and statistical concepts essential for understanding AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science. This module focuses on **Linear Algebra, Statistics, NumPy**, then applying them to learn **Naive Bayes**

## Topics Covered

### 1. Linear Algebra
- Vectors and Matrices
- Matrix Operations (Addition, Multiplication, Transpose, Inverse)
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Applications in Machine Learning (Background substraction,...)

### 2. Statistics
- Probability Theory (Bayes' Theorem, Conditional Probability)
- Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation)
- Correlation and Regression Analysis

### 3. NumPy
- Introduction to NumPy Arrays
- Array Indexing, Slicing, and Reshaping
- Broadcasting and Vectorization
- Mathematical and Statistical Operations
- Linear Algebra Functions using NumPy

### 4. Naive Bayes
- Understanding the Naive Bayes Algorithm
- Basic implemmentation of Naive Bayes
- Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
